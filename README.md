# CISCO-FINAL-PROJECT

The project to design and implement a network for a company with multiple sites in five cities required a comprehensive approach that incorporated various network technologies and protocols. The project involved designing the network using a packet tracer diagram and accompanying narrative, simulating, and testing the network, and correctly configuring OSPF, EIGRP, VLANs, VPNs, HSRP, PPP, DHCP, NAT, PAT, SSH, Access Control Lists, and EtherChannel.
The project also required the correct use of IPv4 and IPv6 addressing and the configuration of a wireless LAN with WLC and DHCP server. Additionally, the project involved providing documentation and configuration files as detailed in the project specification.
Although the project encountered some challenges, including issues with VLAN configuration and addressing, these were addressed through various troubleshooting methods, such as verifying configuration settings, checking logs, and using appropriate tools.
Overall, the project was successful in meeting the company's requirements for a comprehensive and efficient network design that utilizes private addresses throughout, with VLSM used to minimize wasted address space. The project also incorporated the use of various network technologies and protocols to enhance network security, improve network performance, and ensure reliable communication across the company's multiple sites.
