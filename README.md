# CISCO-FINAL-PROJECT

OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES
This final case study allows students to build and configure a complex network using skills gained throughout the course. This case study is not a trivial task. To complete it as outlined with all required documentation will be a significant accomplishment.
The case study scenario describes the project in general terms, and will explain why the network is being built.
Following the scenario, the project is broken into a number of phases, each of which has a detailed list of requirements. It is important to read and understand each requirement to make sure that the project is completed accurately.
The teacher must validate the completion of each phase before passing from one phase to another.
